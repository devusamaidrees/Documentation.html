            <h3>Declearing of Variables in C++</h3>
            <p>Variables in C++ is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. </p>
            <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
            <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.</li>
            <li>In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
            <h3>Rules For Declaring Variable</h3>
            <p>1.The name of the variable contains letters, digits, and underscores.</p>
            <p>2.The name of the variable is case sensitive (ex Arr and arr both are different variables).</p>
            <p>3.The name of the variable does not contain any whitespace and special characters (ex #,$,%,*, etc).</p>
            <p>4.All the variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_). </p>
            <p>5.We cannot used C++ keyword(ex float,double,class)as a variable name.</p>
            <h3>Difference Between Variable Declaration and Definition</h3>
            <p>The variable declaration refers to the part where a variable is first declared or introduced before its first use. A variable definition is a part where the variable is assigned a memory location and a value. Most of the time, variable declaration and definition are done together.</p>
            <h3>Types of Variables</h3> <br>
            <p>There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++</p> <br>
            <li>Local Variables</li>
            <li>Instance Variables</li>
            <li>Static Variables</li> <br>
            <p>Let us now learn about each one of these variables in detail.  </p> <br>
            <p>1.Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. </p>
            <li>These variables are created when entered into the block or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.</li>
            <li>The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access this variable only within that block.</li>
            <li>Initialization of Local Variable is Mandatory.</li> <br>
            <p>2.Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block. </p> 
            <li>As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.</li>
            <li>Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.</li>
            <li>Initialization of Instance Variable is not Mandatory.</li>
            <li>Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.</li> <br>
            <p>3.Static Variables: Static variables are also known as Class variables.</p>
            <li>These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.</li>
            <li>Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.</li>
            <li>Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.</li>
            <li>If we access the static variable like the Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.</li>
            <li>If we access the static variable without the class name, the Compiler will automatically append the class name.</li>
