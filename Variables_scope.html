            <h3>Variables Scope</h3>
            <p>In general, the scope is defined as the extent up to which something can be worked with. In programming also the scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable can be accessed or declared or worked with. There are mainly two types of variable scopes: </p> <br>
            <p>1.Local Variables</p>
            <p>2.Global Variables</p> <br>
            <h3>Local Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions. </p>
            <li>Anything between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ is said to inside a block.</li>
            <li>Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.</li>
            <li>Declaring local variables: Local variables are declared inside a block.</li>
            <h3>Global Variables</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests, Global Variables can be accessed from any part of the program.</p>
            <li>They are available through out the life time of a program.</li>
            <li>They are declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions or blocks.</li>
            <li>Declaring global variables: Global variables are usually declared outside of all of the functions and blocks, at the top of the program. They can be accessed from any portion of the program.</li>
